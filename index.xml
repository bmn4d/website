      <description>Our history
Data Together launched in 2016 in the wake of the Data Rescue movement, as archivers organized into working groups to backup at-risk US federal government datasets.
Since then Data Together has evolved into new model for distributed, community-driven stewardship of data. This model shows how groups of people, companies, institutions, NGOs, and governments can use decentralized and peer-to-peer web infrastructure to access, discover, verify, and preserve data they care about.</description>
