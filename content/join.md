## Join Us!

Data Together's reading group is a set of conversations on themes relevant to information and ethics.
Curated reading selections are distributed once a month; we meet to discuss on video call.

This year, we are creating **blog posts** of each of the conversations, which you can see at [datatogether.org](//datatogether.org).

#### Spring - Summer 2020 Data Together Reading Group

üìÖ 17:30-19:00 ET Tuesdays [**Data Together Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=u75o4fbnv59006peo07nv67vsg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FToronto)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [**Data Together Call Playlist**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtsP3g9LafVul1gCctMYGm9sz5FUWr5bu)

Once a month, we'll host a 1.5 hour discussion of one of our [themes](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether#themes). Everyone should try hard to read the *core* reading (~30 pages), and once or twice sign up to [facilitate discussion](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether#facilitation). [**Join the Google Group**](https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/?place=forum/datatogether/join) to be notified of upcoming meetings and readings.

Our hope is that:
<ul>
  <li>First, we learn together!</li>
  <li>Second, through documenting discussion we can articulate Data Together principles.</li>
</ul>
